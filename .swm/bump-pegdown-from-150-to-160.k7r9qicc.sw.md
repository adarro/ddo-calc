---

# Introduction

This document will walk you through the implementation of the version upgrade feature for the `pegdown` library in our project. The `pegdown` library is a pure-Java Markdown processor that we use for parsing and converting Markdown into HTML in our application. We will cover:

1. Why we decided to upgrade the `pegdown` library version.

2. How the version upgrade was implemented.

# Why upgrade the pegdown library version?

The `pegdown` library is a crucial part of our application as it handles the conversion of Markdown to HTML. Keeping this library up-to-date is important for several reasons:

- **Security**: Newer versions often include patches for security vulnerabilities that have been discovered since the last release.

- **Performance**: Updates often come with performance improvements, making our application faster and more efficient.

- **New Features**: Upgrading to the latest version allows us to take advantage of any new features or improvements that have been added. In this case, we decided to upgrade from version 1.5.0 to 1.6.0 to benefit from the improvements and fixes introduced in this new version.

# How was the version upgrade implemented?

By making this change, we ensure that our application is using the latest, most secure, and efficient version of the `pegdown` library. This will help to improve the overall performance and security of our application.
