/*
APPLIES TO:

This convention should be applied to any project that
- Does NOT directly create a quarkus instance
- uses quarkus components
- is to be 'discovered' / injected via a supported CDI or other annotation Quarkus needs to
be aware of at compile time.

DOES NOT APPLY TO:
(Mutually exclusive) actual quarkus application

You should instead apply 'buildlogic.quarkus-application-conventions' if the module actually invokes
the quarkus engine directly.

WHAT THIS DOES:

Defines Quarkus version information (Bom)

Adds Jandex plugin to provide index of classes / objects / beans Main Quarkus app needs to register.
