## Errata

* Need to add Simple weapons
* [Edritch Blast Damage][eldritch_blast_damage] is listed on Wiki as Eldritch Blast, In game it is listed as Eldritch Blast *Damage*
* Pact-Save Bonus is listed under class feats on Wiki but does not show up under Feats so the we are likely going to apply the bonuses at the CharacterClass Level.
