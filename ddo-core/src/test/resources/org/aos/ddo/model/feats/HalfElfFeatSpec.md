## Dilettante feats

Dilettante feats are special [feats](http://ddowiki.com/page/Feat "Feat") available to [Half-Elves](http://ddowiki.com/page/Half-Elves "Half-Elves"). They enable a Half-Elf to garner some of the abilities of another class other than the class they have chosen. A Half-Elf can choose any one of these feats he or she meets the listed requirements for at [character creation](http://ddowiki.com/page/Character_creation "Character creation").

Along with various bonuses, you, with these feats, count as a level one of the class for item use purposes (class restricted items, [scrolls](http://ddowiki.com/page/Scroll "Scroll") and [wands](http://ddowiki.com/page/Wand "Wand")). These feats are not recommended for characters with actual levels of the class.
