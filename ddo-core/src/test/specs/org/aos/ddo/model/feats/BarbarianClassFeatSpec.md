|Mighty Rage|Passive / Active|The bonuses of the barbarian's rage increase to a total of +10 strength, +10 constitution and +5 to will saving throws but the barbarian still incurs a reduction of his Armor Class by 2. No longer has any fatigue penalties, as they were removed at level17 with Tireless Rage. Enhances the regular Barbarian Rage feat.
|Rage|Active|A Barbarian can fly into a Barbarian Rage a certain number of times per day (Shrine). While raged, a Barbarian temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but they suffer a –2 penalty to Armor Class. When the rage ends, however, you will lose the hit points granted to you by increased Constitution score and become fatigued (–2 penalty to Strength, –2 penalty to Dexterity, -10% penalty to movement speed) for 60 seconds. This penalty is removed later on by the Tireless Rage feat (granted at Barbarian level 17). Also note the Warforged Race is immune to fatigue - including Barbarian fatigue, from level 1. The fatigue may also be removed normally by standard means such as drinking a potion of lesser restoration. You can prematurely end your rage by using the Dismiss Rage feat.  While raging, a barbarian cannot use any Intelligence-based skills or the Concentration skill, nor can he cast spells or activate magic items that require a command word, a spell trigger (such as a wand or clicky), or spell completion (such as a scroll) to function. He can use any feat he has except Defensive Fighting and Combat Expertise. A Barbarian also cannot drink any of the following potions while raged: Remove Curse, Remove Fear, Remove Blindness, Remove Disease unless they are the non-clicky types. Generally ones purchased from a guild vendor are non-clicky. The only clicky-type potion that can be drunk while raged is lesser restore. The duration of Rage is 18 + (Constitution modifier x 6) seconds. The rage-enhanced Constitution score is used for this calculation. The in-game text description of "30 seconds plus an additional amount of time based on your Constitution" is incorrect.
