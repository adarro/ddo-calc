### Item Entity States

Persisting Entities

-   Item
    -   Base Item - May have multiple variants based on enchantments such as 'One of 4 enchantments' or Mythic boost values. These values must be specified when creating an instance.
    -   Multi-level Item
        Item has variants generally based on difficulty levels.
    -   Instance Item - An instance of an Item. This item would be a specific level with any and all options specified such as enchantment choices, augment slots, etc.

We may need a meta-data flag to indicate if an item is a base item and / or if it has variants.
