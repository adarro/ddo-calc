# Evaluation Context

Evaluation context encapsulates the environment in which the expression is evaluated.

For instance, in the following expression for the spell '[Fireball](https://ddowiki.com/page/Fireball)':
Creates a ball of fire that detonates on impact, causing an explosion of flame that deals 1d6+3 points of fire damage per caster level up to a maximum damage of 10d6+30 at caster level 10 to all targets around it.

The evaluation context would include the current caster level, as well as the Max Caster Level.
