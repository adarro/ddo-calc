# Item Lookup and Query operations

One of the biggest issues will be 'getting the data'

When executing a restful query, we need to figure out first, if we have that item and secondly where that item is.

Locating an item or an effect:

-   Wiki - Item is on the wiki
-   Code - Item / Effect is programmatically generated
-   Database - Item / Effect is retrieved from a database
    -   Master Database
    -   Some Local Client Database
