  * Stunning Fist
  *
  * *   **Cost:** 15 [Ki](/page/Ki "Ki")
  * *   **[Cooldown](/page/Cooldown "Cooldown"):** 6 seconds
  * *   **Usage:** [Active](/page/Active_feat "Active feat")
  * *   **Prerequisite:** [Flurry of Blows](/page/Flurry_of_Blows "Flurry of Blows")
  *
  * A swift unarmed attack to vulnerable areas that cause your target to be [stunned](/page/Stunned "Stunned") for 6 seconds if it fails a ([DC](/page/DC "DC") = 10 + half character levels + [Wis](/page/Wis "Wis") mod + other modifiers) [Fortitude save](/page/Fortitude_save "Fortitude save").
  *
  * ### Notes
  *
  *    For many players, Stunning Fist is often the first, if not the preferred, initial attack that a Monk will make.
  *    It can be used over twice as often as [Stunning Blow](/page/Stunning_Blow "Stunning Blow"), which has a 15 second cooldown. With enough ki, a monk could keep an enemy in a state of permanent stun.
  *    The [DC](/page/Difficulty_Class "Difficulty Class") is 10 + half Character level + Wisdom modifier + [Stunning](/page/Stunning "Stunning") item bonus.
  *    Stunning Fist's effectiveness is augmented by a Monk's WIS modifier as well as any items with [Stunning](/page/Stunning "Stunning") enhancements.
  *    Any item, [Epic Destiny](/page/Epic_Destiny "Epic Destiny") ability, or [Epic Destiny Feats](/page/Epic_Destiny_Feats "Epic Destiny Feats") which boosts [Tactics DC](/page/Tactical_feat "Tactical feat") will also increase the effectiveness of Stunning Fist.
  *    Stunning Fist does work on living constructs (such as [Warforged](/page/Warforged "Warforged")). It does not work on constructs, elementals or undead.
  *    Stunning Fist can only be used while wielding [Handwraps](/page/Handwraps "Handwraps").
  *    Stunning Fist does not work in Druid [Wild Shape](/page/Wild_Shape "Wild Shape") even while wearing handwraps or unarmed.
  *    A [Monk](/page/Monk "Monk") may select this feat as one of his [martial arts feats](/page/Martial_arts_feats "Martial arts feats").
