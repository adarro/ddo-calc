## Errata

The following feats are not yet implemented

-   Turn Undead (active and passive): This feat allows the character to halt, or at higher levels destroy, undead
    creatures. The character can do this (3 + their charisma modifier) times per day. While turning undead is an active
    skill, this feat is passive as it adds to the total amount of turns per day. While enhancements from both Cleric and
    Paladin stack, as far as number and power of turns, the base number of turns do not stack with each other.
