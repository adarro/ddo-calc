| [Medium Armor Proficiency][medium_armor]                      | Passive | You are proficient with medium armor, and do not suffer the armor check penalty to attack rolls when wearing medium armor. You also gain 4 + 2/3 of your base attack bonus in physical resistance when wearing medium armor. Notes: A piece of armor with an ACP of 0 can be worn without penalty by all characters whether they're proficient with it or not. You will however still be reminded in the upper right corner of the screen that you are not proficient with what you are wearing. The armor check penalty to skills (if any) and arcane spell failure (if any) of the armor you equip will still apply. Gaining Medium Armor Proficiency through Wizard Eldritch Knight, Sorcerer Eldritch Knight or bard Warchanter enhancements, medium armor will give less PRR than stated, even less than light armor.

This attack deals +1[W] damage. The area of effect is the same as any regular two handed weapons glancing blow reach. The difference is that cleave counts a full attack, dealing full special effect damage to all targets hit, and also producing a glancing blow (if using an appropriate weapon that allows them). Cleave uses a special animation which varies with weapon style, interrupts your regular attack chain, and generally executes at a slower speed. As of update 9, cleave now executes much faster for most weapon styles, resulting in much lower loss of attack speed than before. Additionally, attack speed debuffs do not apply to cleave; if you are under the effects of one, you can actually attack faster by using it. | [Power Attack](https://ddowiki.com/page/Power_Attack "Power Attack")                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
