You also gain 4 + 2/3 of your base attack bonus in physical resistance when wearing medium armor. Notes: A piece of armor with an ACP of 0 can be worn without penalty by all characters whether they're proficient with it or not. You will however still be reminded in the upper right corner of the screen that you are not proficient with what you are wearing. The armor check penalty to skills (if any) and arcane spell failure (if any) of the armor you equip will still apply. Gaining Medium Armor Proficiency through Wizard Eldritch Knight, Sorcerer Eldritch Knight or bard Warchanter enhancements, medium armor will give less PRR than stated, even less than light armor.

level. For instance, a 6th level paladin does 7+(
3\*6) (or 25) extra damage on a successful smite. If the paladin accidentally smites a creature that is not evil, or is not in range, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up. Paladins get one base use of this ability at level one, plus one more at level five and every five levels after 5th (at 10th, 15th and 20th, for a maximum of 5 uses). Smite Evil recharges at a rate of 1 every 90 seconds, and all uses return after any rest period.

Gain the ability to cast Paladin spells. Your effective caster level is equal to your Paladin level, contrary to PnP (

day. While enhancements from both Cleric and Paladin stack, as far as number and power of turns, the base number of
turns do not stack with each other.
