You also gain 4 + 2/3 of your base attack bonus in physical resistance when wearing medium armor. Notes: A piece of armor with an ACP of 0 can be worn without penalty by all characters whether they're proficient with it or not. You will however still be reminded in the upper right corner of the screen that you are not proficient with what you are wearing. The armor check penalty to skills (if any) and arcane spell failure (if any) of the armor you equip will still apply. Gaining Medium Armor Proficiency through Wizard Eldritch Knight, Sorcerer Eldritch Knight or bard Warchanter enhancements, medium armor will give less PRR than stated, even less than light armor.

3\*6) (or 25) extra damage on a successful smite. If the paladin accidentally smites a creature that is not evil, or is

level one, plus one more at level five and every five levels after 5th (at 10th, 15th and 20th, for a maximum of 5
uses). Smite Evil recharges at a rate of 1 every 90 seconds, and all uses return after any rest period.

Gain the ability to cast Paladin spells. Your effective caster level is equal to your Paladin level, contrary to PnP (
thus, the starting duration for a Bless spell is 4 minutes). Turn Undead (active and passive): This feat allows the
character to turn or at higher levels destroy undead creatures. The character can do this (3 + their charisma modifier)
times per day. While turning undead is an active skill, this feat is passive as it adds to the total amount of turns per
day. While enhancements from both Cleric and Paladin stack, as far as number and power of turns, the base number of
turns do not stack with each other.
