Dilettante feats are special [feats](http://ddowiki.com/page/Feat "Feat") available
to [Half-Elves](http://ddowiki.com/page/Half-Elves "Half-Elves"). They enable a Half-Elf to garner some of the abilities
of another class other than the class they have chosen. A Half-Elf can choose any one of these feats he or she meets the
listed requirements for at [character creation](http://ddowiki.com/page/Character_creation "Character creation").

When retraining feats by talking to [Fred](http://ddowiki.com/page/Fred "Fred"), ability

These feats are not recommended for characters with actual levels of the class.
