/**
 * Alchemists hava a unique way of combining their spells as they cast them. As an Alchemist, your
 * spells are each associated with a different Primer: Crimsonite, Gildleaf, or Ceruleite. Casting a
 * spell from a single Primer and then casting a spell from a different Primer will activate a
 * Reaction depending on the Primer of the spells cast. Reactions come in three variants: Pyrite,
 * Verudite or Orchidium.
