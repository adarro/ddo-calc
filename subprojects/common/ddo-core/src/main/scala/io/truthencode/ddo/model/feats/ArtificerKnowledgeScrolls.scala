/**
 * Created by adarr on 2/16/2017. [[https://ddowiki.com/page/Artificer_Knowledge]] This feat grants
 * you benefits based on your Artificer or Alchemist level.
 *
 * Scrolls: Artificer level 1. Grants a +2 to UMD checks related to scroll use, and all scrolls used
 * by the Artificer have their caster levels increased by 1. This caster level bonus increases by 1
 * at Artificer levels 4, 7, 10, and 13, and is capped by the Artificer's Intelligence Bonus. Bug:
 * Currently Artificer Knowledge's UMD check bonus won't work correctly. "Chance to activate" on
 * item description include this feat bonus, but feat bonus does not affect when you use scroll. So
 * if you have this feat and description says 100%, then there is 10% chance to you will fail to
 * activate. The chance to activate does actually increase as it's supposed to. What actually
 * happens is the UMD requirement is lowered by 2. The feat then erroneously counts the knowledge
 * feat for UMD bonus (creating a false bonus of 4) that shows up on the tooltip but doesn't
 * actually happen when using the item. The best thing to do is keep track of your UMD and measure
 * it against the item's stated UMD requirement
