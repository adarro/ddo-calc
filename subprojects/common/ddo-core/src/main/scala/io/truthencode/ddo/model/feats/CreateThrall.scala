 * [[https://ddowiki.com/page/Create_Thrall Create Thrall]] Official: Target enemy fights for you 60
 * seconds. An enemy succeeding on a Will save is instead confused and may indiscriminately attack
 * friend or foe for 10 seconds. Does not affect bosses. Display DC = 15 + Warlock Level + Cha Mod.
 * Displayed DC not affected by Enchantment Focus items. Rather quick casting time; no metamagic
 * feats allowed. Affects also Undead.
