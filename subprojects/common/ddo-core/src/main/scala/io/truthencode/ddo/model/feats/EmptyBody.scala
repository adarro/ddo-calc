/**
 * Created by adarr on 3/17/2017. [[https://ddowiki.com/page/Empty_Body Empty Body]] You are able to
 * focus your ki and walk the edge of the Plane of Shadow, mimicking the effects of a Shadow Walk
 * spell. While this effect is active, you move much faster than normal and your outline appears
 * faint and you are harder to hit. Attacking another creature or otherwise interacting with objects
 * shunts you back to the Material Plane.
