/**
 * [[https://ddowiki.com/page/Great_Cleave Great Cleave]] Active - Special Attack This feat attacks
 * enemies in a wider arc than Cleave, hence Great Cleave has a greater chance to hit more enemies
 * than Cleave. This attack deals +2[W] damage. Cooldown: 6 seconds Usage: Active Prerequisites:
 * Cleave Base Attack Bonus +4
 *
 * @note
 *   Prior to Update 45, it would also produce a glancing blow to each target (if using an
 *   appropriate weapon that allows them). Glancing blows have now been replaced by Strikethrough,
 *   which does not benefit Cleave or Great Cleave.
