/**
  * [[https://ddowiki.com/page/Hide_in_Plain_Sight Hide in Plain Sight]]
  * You are a master when it comes to hiding in places others think impossible. You gain +1 Hide and +1 Move Silently for every three seconds you stand still, up to +5. While you are sneaking and standing still (for 3 seconds), enemies don't gain Spot bonuses until they get much closer to you, and the bonuses are smaller. [Update 19, not tested]
  *
  * Also available in Shadowdancer epic destiny.
