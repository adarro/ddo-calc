/**
 * Icon Feat Improved Precise Shot.png
 * [[https://ddowiki.com/page/Improved_Precise_Shot Improved Precise Shot]] Active - Ranged Combat
 * Stance
 *
 * Your ranged attacks will now pass through friends and foes to damage all foes in your path, until
 * they strike your intended target.
 *
 * Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Dexterity 19, Base Attack Bonus +11
 *
 * Notes A ranger gets this feat for free at level 11, even if he does not meet the prerequisites.
 * Artificers may select this feat as one of their artificer bonus feats. Fighters may select this
 * feat as one of their fighter bonus feats. Tips:
 *
 * Offensive Ranged Stance: Incompatible with Archer's Focus. Many special attacks, even those that
 * usually affect only a single target, can affect all enemies in the path. The projectile continues
 * beyond your selected target. Race height matters. Tall races, such as Bladeforged, shoot their
 * projectiles from a higher elevation. When targeting smaller enemies, projectile travels downwards
 * and often harmlessly flies above the head of nearby enemies. Targeting is easier for smaller
 * races, particularly Halflings.
