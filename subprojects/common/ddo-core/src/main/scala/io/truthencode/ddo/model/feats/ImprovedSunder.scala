 * Icon Feat Improved Sunder.png [[https://ddowiki.com/page/Improved_Sunder Improved Sunder]] Active - Special Attack
 * This melee special attack results in a -5 AC penalty and -10% fortification to the target for 24 seconds, if the
 * target fails a Fortitude save (DC 14 + Str mod). Whether successful or unsuccessful, this attack will also reduce an
 * enemy's Fortitude saves by 3, stacking up to 5 times. Some creatures may be immune to the sunder effect.
