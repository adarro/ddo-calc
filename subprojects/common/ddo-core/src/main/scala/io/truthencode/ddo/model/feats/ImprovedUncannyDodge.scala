/**
 * [[http://ddowiki.com/page/Improved_Uncanny_Dodge Improved Uncanny Dodge]] This feat grants you a
 * 1% passive bonus to Dodge at levels 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 20. Also, you can activate this ability
 * to gain a temporary 50% dodge bonus and a +6 reflex save bonus. As of Update 14, using this
 * ability is no longer restricted by number of uses per rest. However, it is restricted by
 * cooldown.
 *
 * @note
 *   This feat effectively replaces [[https://ddowiki.com/page/Uncanny_Dodge UncannyDodge]] if the
 *   character has both.
 * i.e. Does not stack, but improves the Dodge feat with an improved Active ability. As of Update
 * 14, using this ability is no longer restricted by number of uses per rest. However, it is
 * restricted by cooldown.
 * @todo
 *   Need to add Passive Dodge Bonus
