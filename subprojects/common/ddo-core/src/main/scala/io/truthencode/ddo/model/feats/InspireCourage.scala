/**
 * [[https://ddowiki.com/page/Inspire_Courage Inspire Courage]] Level: Bard 1 Perform: 3 ranks* Target: Bard and all
 * nearby allies Base Duration: Passive aura Song Description: Gives a +1 music bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, and
 * saving throws versus fear, as well as +3 universal Spell Power. Notes: At Bard level 8, this song automatically
 * becomes Improved Inspire Courage and these bonuses rise to +2. At Bard level 14 they rise to +3, and at Bard level 20
 * they rise to +4. Each of these bonuses can be raised through Warchanter enhancements (maximum +3, damage
 * +5[UnverifiedIcon tooltip.png]) and the Fatesinger epic destiny (damage +2, to-hit +4[UnverifiedIcon tooltip.png]).
 * Since Update 41, Inspire Courage is a part of the Bardic Ballad, passive AoE aura automatically affecting nearby
 * allies. Non-bards can access Inspire Courage via Past Life: Bardic Dilettante or the Fatesinger epic destiny. These
 * instances of Inspire Courage are not part of a ballad but have to activated (sung) separately. *Only the base number
 * of Perform ranks bought with skill points count toward the requirement to be able to play this song. (Skill bonuses
 * do not count.) Created by adarr on 4/5/2017.
