/**
 * [[http://ddowiki.com/page/Lay_on_Hands Lay On Hands]] The Paladin ability Lay on Hands heals a
 * friendly target for ( 10 + Paladin level ) x Charisma modifier amount of hit points, or deals
 * that much damage to an undead target. The amount healed does not suffer a penalty when used on
 * Warforged (that is, it heals them for 100% of its total). This ability does not require the
 * paladin to be within melee (touch) range of the friend or foe being targeted, but line of sight
 * is required. This Paladin feat is granted at level 2, and may be used once per rest. The Extra
 * Lay on Hands enhancements may be taken at level 1 and above to increase the number of uses per
 * rest.
 *
 * Notes This can also be acquired and enhanced through the Unyielding Sentinel Epic Destiny without
 * requiring any Paladin levels.
