/**
 * [[https://ddowiki.com/page/Mass_Suggestion_(song) Mass Suggestion (song)]] Level: Bard 18
 * Perform: 21 ranks* Target: Multiple enemies affected by Fascinate Base Duration: 30 seconds
 * Saving Throw: Will negates, 10 + Â½ bard level + Cha modifier Song Description: This song charms
 * multiple foes that are currently under the effects of the bardic Fascinate song.
 * @note
 *   This song does not work on enemies that have been mesmerized by any other bardic song, such as
 *   Music of the Dead, Music of the Makers, or Enthrallment. This song benefits from effects that
 *   increase song duration. Unlike spell version, can charm any number of enemies within range if
 *   they are fascinated. Likewise, Negative Level, charm effect expires quickly on Epic Hard and
 *   higher difficulty (10~15 seconds). *Only the base number of Perform ranks bought with skill
 *   points count toward the requirement to be able to play this song. (Skill bonuses do not count.)
 *   Created by adarr on 4/5/2017.
