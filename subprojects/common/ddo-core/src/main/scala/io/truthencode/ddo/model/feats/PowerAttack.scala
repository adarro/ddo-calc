/**
 * [[http://ddowiki.com/page/Power_Attack Power Attack]] This feat exchanges part of your attack
 * bonus for extra melee damage. It reduces your hit bonus by 5, or your Base Attack Bonus,
 * whichever is lower. Then your successful attacks will have their damage increased by the same
 * amount. Two-handed weapons get twice that damage bonus. (Unarmed strikes count as one-handed.)
 * Typically, this means one-handed weapons get +5 and two-handed get +10 to damage.
 *
 * This feat is a stance. It may be toggled on and left active indefinitely. When deactivated, there
 * is a 10 second cooldown before it can be used again.
 *
 * @todo
 *   add Cooldown with Toggle likely inconsequential but only applies when toggling off then on
 *   again
 * @todo
 *   add Offensive Combat Stance
