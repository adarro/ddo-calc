/**
 * [[https://ddowiki.com/page/Quivering_Palm Quivering Palm]] Starting at 15th level, a monk can set
 * up fatal vibrations within the body of a living creature. Constructs, oozes, plants, undeads,
 * incorporeal creatures such as wraiths, and creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected,
 * but other creatures must make a Fortitude Save after being struck by the Quivering Palm or die
 * instantly. The saving throw is equal to DC of 10 + (monk level)/2 + wisdom modifier.
 *
 * @note
 *   Update 19 changes:
 *
 * Quivering Palm may now be used with Monk weapons. Quivering Palm now gains DC bonuses from all
 * enhancements, feats, items, and Epic Destiny abilities that increase Sunder DC. Update 21
 * changes:
 *
 * Quivering Palm gains DC bonuses from general tactical combat boosts, but not Sundering items.
 * Whenever an enemy saves vs. Quivering Palm, you get a stacking +4 bonus to your Quivering Palm
 * DC. This stack is dispelled when you successfully kill someone with Quivering Palm (or 3 minutes
 * pass).
 * @todo
 *   Some Tactical bonuses are confirmed not working So not sure if flagging this tactical is
 *   accurate programmatically
