/**
 * [[https://ddowiki.com/page/Ruin_(feat) Ruin]] Name: Ruin School: Transmutation (Force) Level:
 * Epic Feats, level 27 Spell Point Cost: 75 Components: none Metamagic: Empower, Maximize, Quicken
 * Range: Standard Target: Foe Duration: Instantaneous Saving Throw: No Spell Resistance: No
 * Cooldown: 15 seconds Description: Deals 500 untyped damage to a single enemy. (No saving throw.)
 *
 * @note
 *   Force Spell Power applies to this spell. Using metamagic feats increases the cost.
 * @todo
 *   ERRATA: This is a Feat, but metamagic cost etc. affect it, so we likely treat it as a spell
 *   instead of SLA? Created by adarr on 4/3/2017.
