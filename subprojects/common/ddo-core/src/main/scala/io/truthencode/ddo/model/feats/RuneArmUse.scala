/**
 * [[https://ddowiki.com/page/Rune_Arm_Use Rune Arm Use]] Passively, you are able to equip and use
 * magical relics called Rune Arms. When this feat is toggled on, it will set the rune arm to
 * automatically begin charging whenever it can. While you have a Rune Arm charging, tapping the
 * Rune Arm Key (default: Alt) will fire the Rune Arm. You can freely perform most other actions
 * while charging the Rune Arm. Created by adarr on 2/16/2017.
