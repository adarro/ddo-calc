 * Icon Feat Sap.png [[https://ddowiki.com/page/Sap Sap]] Active - Special Attack This feat has a
 * chance to render the target briefly senseless, though it will become active if damaged again.
 * Some creatures may be immune to the sap effect and sap is more effective when performed as a
 * successful sneak attack (whether or not your character can normally perform sneak attacks).
 * @todo
 *   Currently flagged as a tatical Feat, but there is no save and therefore does not benefit (or
 *   need to) from tactical bonuses per se
