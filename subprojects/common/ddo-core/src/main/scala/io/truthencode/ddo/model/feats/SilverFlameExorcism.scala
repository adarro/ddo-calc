/**
 * [[https://ddowiki.com/page/Silver_Flame_Exorcism Silver Flame Exorcism]] You are a devoted
 * follower of the Silver Flame, and your faith has been rewarded. Activate this ability to attempt
 * to exorcise an extraplanar creature, which is entirely consumed in holy fire on a failed Will
 * save or savagely burned by the light of the Silver Flame. A successful Fortitude save reduces the
 * damage to half. The Save DC for this ability is 10 + Cleric Level + Charisma Modifier. Cooldown:
 * 10 minutes. Created by adarr on 4/7/2017.
