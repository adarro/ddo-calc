/**
  * [[https://ddowiki.com/page/Slow_Fall Slow Fall]]
  * A monk's focus allows him to reduce gravity's effects.
  * This feat can be turned off should he desire normal gravity.
  * The Monk must be centered to use this ability, and its ability to reduce falling damage increases every two levels.
  * In practice, even when this feat is turned off, a monk falls more slowly than he would normally.
  *
  * @note
  * This class feat does indeed provide a reduced gravity effect as the name suggests,
  * but for the physics-minded of you it does so exactly as it should, scientifically speaking. I
  * t does not affect the maximum speed you can reach in a fall due to the effect of gravity,
  * it merely affects the rate at which gravity will increase the speed of your fall, and thus your damage on landing,
  * until Perfect Slow Fall at Monk Level 20. What this means in applicable terms is this: at lower levels of Slow Fall,
  * it will reduce the damage you suffer when falling only on small to medium falls. On longer falls and at higher levels,
  * even with the reduced rate of acceleration, you still have time to reach the maximum fall speed for that distance
  * and will take identical damage whether you use the feat or not. Unlike Feather FallingIcon tooltip.png,
  * monks do not glide as far with Slow Fall in effect, making a feather falling item still useful.
  * (Update 8: A known-bug in the game may cause Slow Fall to be operating, even when the feat is turned off.)
