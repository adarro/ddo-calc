/**
 * This feat has a chance to trip the target rendering it prone for a short time. Strength or
 * Dexterity save (whichever is higher) is used to oppose a DC of 10 + Strength modifier + related
 * Enhancements + Vertigo. Some creatures may be immune to this effect. Creatures larger or stronger
 * than you are less likely to trip. A successful Balance check negates this effect (DC of 10 +
 * Strength modifier + related Enhancements + Vertigo).
