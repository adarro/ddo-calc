/**
 * Prerequisites Icon Feat Two Weapon Fighting.png Two Weapon Fighting Passive Reduces the to-hit
 * penalty when using two weapons at the same time. The penalty for your primary hand lessens by 2
 * and the one for your off-hand lessens by 6, resulting in -4/-4 (instead of -6/-10 without this
 * feat). If the off-hand weapon is light, both penalties decrease by another 2 points, down to
 * -2/-2 (instead of -4/-8 without this feat). Two Weapon Fighting also increases the chance to proc
 * an off-hand attack by 20% (applies to unarmed Monk), bringing the total chance to 40%.

 * Dexterity 15
