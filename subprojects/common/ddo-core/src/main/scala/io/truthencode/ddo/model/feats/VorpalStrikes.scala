/**
 * [[https://ddowiki.com/page/Vorpal_Strikes Vorpal Strikes]] Usage: Active, Toggled Stance
 * Prerequisite: Monk Level 12, Wisdom 23, Improved Critical:Bludgeoning Weapons. Description Your
 * unarmed strikes are now considered vorpal and slashing.
 *
 * Notes Epic Feat available for selection at level 21, 24 or 27. You need at least 12 levels of
 * Monk in your character to qualify for this feat. Vorpal Strikes is a Monk stance, similar to Slow
 * Fall. The feat is switched off on character login. The stance co-exists with general stances such
 * as Power Attack and Monk stances such as Mountain Stance. This ability does not make unarmed
 * strikes considered slashing weapons in regard to Ninja Spy (No poison, no dex-to-damage or hit),
 * it simply adds an additional damage type.
 * @todo
 *   need to verify epic level selection functionality is handled Created by adarr on 4/6/2017.
