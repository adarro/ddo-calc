 * Touch range refers to pretty much as it sounds - you have to almost touching your target for the

/**
 * Standard range refers to a standardized fixed distance. For AOE buff type spells such as bless or
 * haste, you can see the actual area affected by the spells animation
 *   - about 15 feet. Pretty much every AOE buff spell in the game have the same range as these 2
 *     spells, but some do not display a graphic, so use those as the guide. For Offensive spells
 *     and targeted buff spells with standard range, the actual range is about double a standard
 *     buff AOE, so roughly 30 feet.

 * Double range refers to exactly twice the range that standard spells have. Generally pretty much
