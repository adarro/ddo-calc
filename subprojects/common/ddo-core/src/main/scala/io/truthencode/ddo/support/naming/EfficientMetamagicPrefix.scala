 * Created by adarr on 3/5/2017. Display Prefix for meta magic enhancements
 *
 * @example
 *   Alchemist Enhancement Efficient Metagagics in Bombardier line has selectors for Efficient Empower
 *
 * @note
 *   it expects the specific meta magic name to be set via namesource such that withPrefix.getOrElse("").namesource
 *   would produce 'Efficient Empower' This can be further suffixed i.e. RomanNumerals
