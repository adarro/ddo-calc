  * encapsulates the critical damage profile
  *
  * @example a typical weapon may have a damage range of 1-20 with a bonus for
  * certain high rolls.  The scimatar for example may have 1-20, with 18-20 receiving
  * a bonus damage multiplier of double damage.  This is written in terms of 18-20 x3.
  *
  * programatically, this would be represented as
  * {{{
  * val cp = critProfile(min = 18, max=20, multiplier = 2)
  * }}}
  * @param min minimum damage roll
  * @param max maximum damage roll
  * @param multiplier amount to multiply when a given roll is within the min / max range.
  *
  * @todo may move this to core package
